# 3phase_quality_analyzer

I developed this analyzer for my PhD work. I didn't finished it, so just put it OpenSource with MIT license for help other developers with this.

The main idea is to develop measurement module for getting raw data, and put on the top of it processing module, which would calculate different metrics and stats and send them to distributed network.
